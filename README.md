# Camerawowoman mod for Eternity

### What is Camerawowoman? 

Not really sure if it's possible to port the zdoom cameraman this to eternity, but I might as well try.

**Camerawoman** is a mod for the [Eternity Engine](https://github.com/team-eternity/eternity).

Use it to create camera profiles, play them back in-engine and capture as clips for your videos or movies! 

Possible use cases:
- make trailers for Doom engine maps and mods
- create machinima in Doom engine
- capture Doom gameplay from 3rd person
- _other creative usages you may think of_
